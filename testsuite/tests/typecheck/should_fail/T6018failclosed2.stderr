    Calling type family ‘PClosed’ is not allowed in injective type family equation:
      PClosed ('S n) m = 'S (PClosed n m)
    In the equations for closed type family ‘PClosed’
    In the type family declaration for ‘PClosed’

      PClosed ('S n) m = 'S (PClosed n m)
      PClosed 'Z m = m
    In the equations for closed type family ‘PClosed’
    In the type family declaration for ‘PClosed’
