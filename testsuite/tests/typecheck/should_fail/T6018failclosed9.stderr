    Type family equations violate injectivity annotation:
      E2 'True = 'False
      E2 a = 'False
    In the equations for closed type family ‘E2’
    In the type family declaration for ‘E2’

    Type family equation violates injectivity annotation.
    Type variable ‘a’ should appear in the RHS of type family equation:
      E2 a = 'False
    In the equations for closed type family ‘E2’
    In the type family declaration for ‘E2’
