    Type family equation violates injectivity annotation.
    Injective type variables ‘a’, ‘b’ do not appear in the RHS of type family equation
    Kind variable ‘k’ is not inferable from the RHS of type family equation
    forall (k :: BOX) (a :: k) (b :: k). Gc a b = Int
    In the equations for closed type family ‘Gc’
    In the type family declaration for ‘Gc’
